Though there is no way to enforce it, I ask that my name be kept in the header
file to give credit where credit is due. You did not write this code, you only
downloaded it. Just because you bought a book doesn't mean you should scribble
out the author's name, write your own in its place, and tell people you wrote
it.

This is obviously open source and free to use by anyone for anything.
